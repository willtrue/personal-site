			I'm a product manager at <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>, where I work on features and products that empower creators to tell their stories and connect with audiences.

			Right now, I lead the product teams behind Vimeo's native applications on mobile and TV, the public API, and our efforts to make Vimeo a platform where 3rd-party developers can be successful. Prior to Vimeo, I was at <a href="https://www.ted.com">TED</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a>.

			I graduated from the <a href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/">University of Puget Sound</a>, where I majored in International Political Economy and minored in Business. if you would like to get in touch, feel free to <a href="mailto:wt@willtrue.com">shoot me an email</a> or <a href="https://keybase.io/willtrue">encrypted message</a>.
